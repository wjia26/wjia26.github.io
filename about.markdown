I'm a Data Analyst @ [Carsales.com.au](https://www.carsales.com.au) in their Data Science & Analytics Team. My experience has generally been around using data, code and business acumen to create actionable insights to drive certain business metrics. So far I've been exposed to the Energy and Online Website industries.  

However, as an Engineering Major I can't help but appreciate good design and I do get the itch to build things. This website is meant to be a place where I can share some of these passion projects.

In my spare time I enjoy reading autobiographies, playing sport, dabbling in stocks and talking nonsense. I'm also abit of a classical music elitist.
