I'm a Product Data Analyst @ Carsales.com.au in their Data Science & Analytics Team. My experience has generally been around creating tools to collate data from various sources and creating actionable insights to drive a certain business metric. However, as an Engineering Major I can't help but appreciate good design and I do get the itch to build things.

In my spare time I enjoy reading autobiographies, playing sport and talking nonsense. I'm also abit of a classical music elitist.
