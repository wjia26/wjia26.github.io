Communication is really important. Especially if you're in a field where attaining mutual understanding between human beings is key.
It's essentially what makes humans - well human. It was the homosapiens ability to convey thought with depth and conciseness which lead to our species to be able to flourish for millenia. Not being able to communicate well can cause your ideas to get lost in the wind and for your efforts not to be in-sync with others. Which is probably okay if you're a mad scientist or someone who works completely alone (which is hugely rare). Communication is the crux of how ideas flow. 

There are different aspects of communication like verbal and non-verbal - which you will use more will depend on what profession you're in.
For example: A team of soccer players might come from different nations across the world, each player having a different mother tongue. Although, verbally the communication might be limited - non-verbally the players understand each others rhythm and playstyle, allowing for a non-verbal type of communication to flow through the team. This enables the intricate game of soccer to be played cohesively without someone shouting around every 2 seconds. 

Another example is: You might be a writer for the New York Times. Your audience can only understand you through the medium of writing. The better you are at verbalizing your thoughts in to writing - the better your readers will understand you. This requires verbal communication. 

I think understanding the space in which you work in and tailoring how you communicate to your strengths can do wonders. There is no one correct way to communicate.
Not everyone has to be that extroverted orator who can spit out a plan with precision. Not everyone needs to be able to be an expert writer who's vocabulary knows no bounds. Everyone has there own unique way of communicating and finding out what it is and how to best deliver it is the best thing you can do.

Like, personally I'm not the greatest verbalizer of thoughts (although I am getting better at it) - nor am I the best at writing them down. You wouldn't believe how long it took for me to write things down as a kid - I would always get stuck for words trying to say something that was absurdly trivial in my head. That's because I'm more of a non-verbal and visual communicator. I like to communicate via actions and visual storytelling. I'm a huge proponent of using analogies to relate foreign ideas to more familiar ones - because that's just how my mind works. I like to seek patterns and explain them in a visual way. Which is why I always like drawing things to explain to people. The large part of why I enjoyed math and physics so much was because I could visualize the problems. Even the formulas and symbols were sort of like mini-drawings in themselves. I also tend to communicate directly as opposed to indirectly - but this depends on the situation.

So in my day-to-day job as a Data Analyst, I often like to have that face-to-face interaction with something for me to show. So when it comes time for me to explain what's on my mind I can just point and draw out what I mean if my mouth and tongue fail me. I also need to look at things from an unbiased perspective whilst acknowledging the Products point of view.

The other part is then knowing how the other person likes to communicate and knowing how to communicate in a way that steers a bigger objective. This focuses on more on how you can effectively come to a longer-term positive consensus with the other person whilst maintaining a positive relationship. This is more leadership stuff - when you need to be able to use your influence for the greater good (selfish or self-less). The key thing here is a "positive consensus". An example would be instead of actively trying to convince someone that your method is superior - perhaps just throw the idea in there and have a discussion about it from a third-persons point of view. Be willing to criticize your own method and open to a better one (assuming it is not to the detriment yourself). 

Identifying something that is "win-win" - atleast in the other persons eyes - is crucial.

Again, one must tailor the communication to the profession and the sorts of circumstances you will be in.

Remember, communication is a tough thing to master - and because it isn't necessarily technical it can be easily forgotten and not really methodically worked on.As with every skill, you just have to keep trying different methods and keep putting yourself in situations where your communication is relied upon. Perhaps speaking to someone who does it for a living (like a comedian/actor/writer/salesman) will give you some insight on how to take steps to honing it in.
