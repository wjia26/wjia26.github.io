The video above gives a good explanation of how data can be misleading. Along with this, I'm sure most will understand other reasons to take data with a grain of salt.
Things like "Correlation doesn't imply causation" or the difference between a model that's predictive as opposed to prescriptive. If these are not concepts you've heard about, I'd suggest doing a quick google search before reading onwards.

A really good website about the ridiculousness of the former can be found here in [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). Where pairs of completely random statistics in the world are plotted with each other in the name of correlation. Implying causation for any of these graphs would definitely not make any sense.

In addition to these, I'd also like to point out some instances of data that could be somewhat misleading, which can affect our daily lives and how we perceive the world seeing as it is becoming more and more digital. Alot of our perception of things are through the lense of product reviews, popularity on social media, the comments on youtube. All which are things that can be manipulated either manually or through an algorithm - either with a purpose or unsuspectingly. The realizations of these instances are actually quite trivial when you really think about it - it's more about being aware of it as you consume media and understanding how it can passively affect your perception.


## 1. Food reviews (google or professional)
Is it me or are all google food reviews have a rating of more than 4 stars? Like 4 stars has become the the new "average" and 4.5 is like "good".
Even so, I've been to plenty of restaurants where the high rating is (as law students like to put it) [***"mere puffery"***](https://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/carlill.html). The problem with food reviews is that they are usually a sweeping generalization of what the voters think is considered "good food". i.e. the sample of those who post food reviews on the internet. Who are they to judge what I personally do or do not like. Like I understand we probably all have a set of common standards for what "good food" entails - things like cleanliness, likelihood of getting food poisoning, the freshness of ingredients. But we all have like 20% where our opinions will differ depending on personal preferences and culture. What might be 5 stars to me, could be 2 stars for you. Just like how beer to a 10 year old might taste bitter and nasty (0 stars) - but to an adult it's the pinnacle of quenching a hard earned thirst (5 stars). Or a seasoned professional chef might be able to appreciate the nuances of a expensive caviar where as a layman might just look and say "salty balls". That's why you can't merely judge a restaurant by it's cover (it's zomato/yelp review) - you have to actually go inside and judge it for yourself. 

Furthermore, food reviews can be susceptible to review hacking - whereby the owner can just employ a bunch of randoms to say positive things about the restaurant. I feel like this has become more and more rampant in the past years - hence the reason for every restaurant getting like 4+ star ratings. It's harder to judge the quality without actually going in because of all these poser restaurants just boosting their ratings. Apparently every restaurant around my neighbourhood is good!?

I think food reviews still have a place in the eating out decision process - however it should only serve as a rough guideline. As long as the restaurant isn't shut down for poor hygiene - anything is up for grabs I say.

## 2. Youtube Comments/reddit threads/Any discussion forum really
This is an interesting one. Have you ever found yourself reading the youtube comments and scrolling endlessly to see the reactions of other people in the community. Sometimes, I catch myself reading that before I even delve into the contents of the video - just to get a sense-check of the "legitness" of the video. Then I read it after to see if others have the same thoughts as I do - or if anyone has posted something hilarious in commentary to the video. Youtube comments represent a huge part of the video viewing experience. I can't imagine what it'd be like without them - I guess humans like to feel like their part of a community that understands them and reaffirm thoughts that are already in their head.

This however, causes a sort of herd mentality within the comments section. First of all, there's the initial condition of those who watch the video are likely to represent a subset of the entire population. i.e. those who watch technology videos are more likely to be those who are tech savvy, those who watch investing videos are more likely to be more financially focused...etc. Then there is the ongoing continuous process of those in these groups reinforcing one anothers ideas until it seems like the ground truth. What started out as opinions gradually get positively reinforced to become gospel - or even rules by which these communities live by. A really high like to dislike ratio then further bolsters these opinions aswell.  

The end result is a group of people who engage (for better or worse) in this massive group think - where ideas who go against the natural flow of the comments section might get immidiately dismissed because it doesn't fit the general vibe.

I've seen the same idea being discussed in a completely different lens just because they are in different forums or different comments sections in the youtube universe. For every idea you find being championed by someone in the youtube community - you'll find an opposing idea with an equally fervent applauding viewership. Newtons first law in the youtube world. For every TEDx talk telling you to follow your dreams - you'll find one which talks about being grounded and accepting reality.

It is easy to take these simplified metrics that youtube gives you: the like-dislike ratio, number of people who watched the videos, the comments section - and let it sway your internal thoughts about something. Whether it's the decision to purchase a product, or form an opinion about a taboo subject - groupthink can have a powerful passive effect on peoples thought patterns. 

What makes it worse is that youtube is now highly commercial. The more engaged viewers, the more ad revenue and more sponsors. How do you get people to watch your videos? By appealing to the masses. People are paid to essentially represent a populist/highly trivialized opinion - an opinion which might not apply to your specific circumstance. I mean who wants to spend the time to face their inner demons and understand themselves better to strategize a pathway for themselves - when they can simply avoid the harsh truth and watch a video which promises "10 shortcuts to financial freedom" or "5 ways to be more charismatic". This is more escapism than it is educational.

It's hard to find channels that aren't motivated by some form of commercial success. 

Take social commentary with a grain of salt and be critical of it before taking it as a source of advice.
