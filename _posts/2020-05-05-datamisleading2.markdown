Okay lets continue this thing...

## 3. Statistics about Salary/Career choices.
"The average X makes Y amount". "Top 10 careers to get into." "Why you should quit your Z Job"
Using career websites like Glassdoor/SEEK to make informed decisions can be useful - but also a trap at the sametime.

Again, a common theme with this one and the food reviews and youtube vidoes I covered before is that it serves up **Aggregated Data**.
Data, if even true, that is generalized for the subset of people which work in that particular role. 

Data, which follows fancy latin assumption, [***ceteris paribus***](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceterisparibus.asp), meaning "all else being equal". "All else" comprising of: the years of experience required, the level of aptitude for the chosen role, the dedication and passion required, the types of personalities which would thrive in this role. 
And that is most often the assumption that people miss out on. They think these assumptions also apply to them - which is completely wrong. Unless you have the exact characteristics of the average person in that profession.
People flock to a certain degree/career path thinking that it would net them a certain amount of pay, or command a certain amount of respect just because they've seen there friends go through it with success - or seen on a whirlpool site that someone is making a ridiculous amount doing so.

This is entirely trivializing the situation. Perhaps, for your characteristics you'd be better served say becoming a video editor rather than becoming a lawyer at a prestigious law firm because you're more of a creative type and your personality would thrive better in such an environment. You might even earn more if you become really good at it. Obviously you'll have to check what the demand is for being a video editor is like and perhaps be accepting that it might be a higher risk career. But you shouldn't based your opinion on the law of averages, if you do not represent the average.

I think we can become prone to interpreting the data in these websites like Glassdoor to the point where it commoditizes our contributions and worth to society as human beings. We all have different talents and personalities which will have a big impact on the success in a particular career path. The average lawyer might earn more than the average video editor - but perhaps you have the aptitude to become the top 1% of video editors but can only ever be a below average lawyer. Perhaps in this case you'd earn multiple times more being a video editor whilst also enjoying the heck out of the work you're producing. Ofcourse the hard part is determining whether you can become the top 1% of video editors in the first place.


## 4. Profound quotes
Often in opinion pieces will use a famous idiom to bolster the argument. 
- "Actions speak louder than words."
- "Look before you leap."
- "Clothes maketh the man."
- "Many hands make light work." 

These idioms have been drilled in so much that they have become staple quotes in our everyday lives. We use them to describe situations, explain them and even rely on them to move forward. The disconcerting thing is, they all have an exact opposite and equally profound quote which completely contradicts them.

- "The Pen is mightier than the sword."
- "He who hesisates loses."
- "Never judge a book by its cover."
- "Too many cooks spoil the broth."
Again, this is unfortunately an example of aggregated data coming into play. Someone has take there on life experiences,aggregated and distilled it into a catchy quote and people have taken this as ground truth. More examples can be found [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-quotes-that-contradict-other-quotes-just-opposite-to-them)

Lets take the example of (1)"Many hands make light work" vs. (2)"Too many cooks spoil the broth". 
If you were running a large scale operation where the instructions are easy to understand and success is defined by the quantity and amount of time spent - perhaps this would ring true. To solve this problem - just throw bodies at it and bobs your uncle.(Something like a warehouse/manufacturing plant comes to mind.) 
However, you were out to design the best watch - with each component heavily considered and deliberated across the team. Each component following a similar design pattern and remaining consist and precise through out the timepiece. This is not something you can just throw bodies at - in this case, getting the wrong person for the team could prove more detrimental than helpful as there it would introduce too many clashing ideas - it would figuratively "spoil the broth".


## Summary: Always interrogate the data and use your own understandings as a guideline.
The more specific the data is to your use case - the better insights you will be able to draw from it. It's pretty hard finding data that contains exactly the required assumptions for your situation - but even just being aware that averages are heavily generalized for a certain group can help you make a more informed decision.

There are obviously some instances where generalizations work. For example: all humans require sleep, shelter and like to not starve.
The laws of physics and maths are going to apply to everyone until proven otherwise aswell. And even they have certain conditions too.

It's more when aggregated data assumes a certain condition that can vastly change depending on circumstance is where it can play jedi mind tricks.
