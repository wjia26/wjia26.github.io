All this self-isolation has been making me extra self-reflective over the past couple of days. I've been questioning alot of the goals I've had and whether or not they've actually aligned with who I am.

This question has always been such a tricky one because it just seems to keep changing over time. Every couple of months I'll get stuck in a rut trying to figure out the best way forward for my future ambitions and it always ends up in sleepless nights weighing up the endless possibilities of the world. That's the problem with having access to so much information nowadays - there just seems to be infinitely many pathways you can take - the choice is simply overwhelming. What ends up happening is you sort of half-ass things and never fully commit to an idea you want to explore. I've definitely been guilt of this. 

Initially I wanted to become an Mechanical Engineer then I pivoted to Electrical. I had my sights set on becoming an academic and going into research - but then got scared about the lack of human contact and dreaded reading the tonnes of papers required to get a PhD. I also lowkey just wanted to finally get paid and not have to walk into a uni I had been going to for the past 5.5 years. And now I'm in the Data field.

It's a tough balancing act of first of all finding out what you genuinely enjoy and are good at vs. whether society needs that thing and it's financial gain.
This inevitably comes down to who you are, your belief system, understanding yourself and having the guts to accept it.

## What drives you? 
Probably one of the most important things you can ask yourself. Everything that you do day-to-day should be tailored towards an inner drive. The key is - you have to be honest with yourself of what it is. It is funny because when you ask this to many people - many will say some altruistic goal but will never mention one thing - money. It would be insane for you not to consider money as a driving factor and it is dangerous not to admit it. If obtaining large sums of cash for whatever reason, is truly your goal, don't hide it from yourself. But ofcourse you need to understand why you'd want all that money and what you would use it for. It is as much a driving factor as someone saying they like to help people or becoming super knowledgeable in one thing. 

In the end, it's about alignment.

For me personally, it is one of the driving factors but probably not the biggest one. I generally prioritize becoming really skilled at a particular area and being respected for it and also having like-minded people around me who understand my dumb humour. But still...not going to deny that money is part of the equation when deciding a future career in something. Else, I'd be a blacksmith or something, making swords or playing video-games all day. 

## Knowing your strengths and limitations
Only way to know this is by actually trying a whole bunch of stuff out and see if you have an aptitude for something. Once you've got the lay of the land you need to identify areas that you are good and are not good at. Again, the tough part about this is being honest. I had the toughest time doing this as a kid I think. And it was only around a year ago that I had finally tried to be true to my capabilities and who I am. For the longest time I had always overestimated my intelligence and underestimated my people skills. It took me years to figure out that I actually wasn't the genius I thought I was and I wasn't the biggest social dumbass I had envisioned in my head. 

Being honest with yourself also means forgetting about what you trained in and any preconcieved notions you have about yourself. Just because you're an English Major doesn't mean you aren't extremely good at logic/structure and thus could actually be a great fit for being a software developer. Just because you did Engineering doesn't mean you can't be creative and seek out ways to capitalise on that ability. 

What ends up happening is that school ends up pigeon-holing you into academic areas that lead you to maximize the grade you will get. Like for me, I was pretty good at math - so I ended up taking a bunch of math subjects, doing well in them - which lead me to believe that I'm definitely an Engineering Type and that I should be a math guy for the rest of my life. Which by and large I am - but it really caused my 18 year old self to tunnel vision into career prospects that only involved me and a calculator of some sort. I didn't have the maturity to challenge that idea I had in my head - that maybe I could be even better at another area that typically wasn't examined in an end of year test. Skills like being good with people, visual arts and even being funny are things that don't really do much for your academics - but should definitely be explored if you have a knack for it. You don't need the acknowledgement from doing well in an exam to go for it.   

The hard part is identifying that niche and then having the patience to try again and again until you realize it is or it isn't working for you. Ofcourse there's a bit of luck involved with finding that one thing you're good at. You won't imagine how many things are very much dependent on the economy and timing. 

## Knowing the macro-landscape
So you've identified what it is you're good at and what drives you. What pathways are actually feasible in this day and age? If you want to sustain a living, what pathways actually make dough? What is the reality of going about this career pathway?

For example: You can set-off to become a film-maker on Youtube because what drives you is being creative and having an large audience to experience what you've made and enjoy it. However, perhaps what you make isn't aligned with the broader social media, maybe it isn't advertiser friendly, maybe the video format requires you to spend like a month editing it for very little views. You inevitably have to shift to more clickbait subjects and thus sacrifice your creativity for what works. 

These are the sorts of realities you must try to pre-empt in your head.
