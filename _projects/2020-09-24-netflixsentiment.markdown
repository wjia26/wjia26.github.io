## #CancelNetflix

So it's been in the news that people all over the world are trying to [cancel netflix](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a33990652/cancel-netflix-cuties-twitter-reaction/){:target="_blank"} over their promotion of the film "Cuties" on their platform.

I thought it would be cool to analyse the change in sentiment everyday on the #Netflix hashtag on twitter considering I'm already ingesting it on my twitter sentiment app.

You can see a huge drop in sentiment after the film got released on their platform. However, what's interesting is that the recovery is quite quick. Almost __10 days__ later people seem to have forgotten about it and #Netflix sentiment seems to recover. Quite typical of today's hyper quick turnaround of attention where people can be quick to take up arms against something - before they flock to the next thing. 

We are all bloody goldfish sometimes.

I personally have not seen this film nor do I have an opinion on the reactions of the public against/for this film. However, it's just interesting to see the relatively short term impact it's had.
