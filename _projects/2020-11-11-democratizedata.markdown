## Free the Data!
I'm a big proponent of freeing and sharing datasets for people to use in their own projects. Most often the barrier to entry for doing cool data science projects is clean/abundant and quality datasets.

It's very hard to find twitter datasets that span a long period of time - with tweets deduplicated and cleaned. Often users will need to use the twitter API. Which is easy to use, but will only yield the past days worth of data. What if you wanted more? Then you're shit out of luck.

I hope to combat this issue in the space of twitter data.

Over the past couple of months I've been collecting tweet data, classifying it's sentiment and storing in my own low-cast datalake. Please see my previous posts about building the datalake for more details.

Unfortunately, twitter has decided to suspend two of my accounts - which is essentially brought the data collection process to a halt. I will try get it back up and running.

I've posted these datasets on Kaggle so that anyone can use it to analyze or build a cool machine learning model off of it. Collective thus far we've reached around 100 downloads on these datasets! Hopefully more to come in the future.
