## Let's build a Background Generator

So after watching [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/videos) videos on Perlin Noise and getting some inspiration off of other generative artists - I decided it would be cool to create a wallpaper generator.

I remember in the past when I would try search for wallpapers, they would come in all sorts of sizes - none of which you could scale to your desired resolution.
So I've built a generative random background generator, enabling the user to input width and height in pixels to save a cool looking mountainous background.

I've tried to stick to the basic rule of 3rd's and also picked "muted" colours - where a "muted" colour is any colour with in a RGB range centered in the middle (128,128,128). That ensures the picture doesn't look too colourful.

The program generates a bunch of random perlin noise for the mountain ranges, aswell as where the moon is positioned and how big it is.

Throughout this process I learnt that Art isn't just chaos and completely random - but it has structure and also order to it aswell. 

Perfect for those stock linkedin backgrounds!

Again this is made using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - which is proving to be an extremely intuitive and fun framework to program in. I wouldn't call myself a javascript afiocionado - however using this framework I've been able to get this basic app up and running which I find really fulfilling and powerful.
