## Let's see what we can build with this thing.
So I stumbled across this creative coding framework called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Turns out it's pretty cool and you can make some sick visuals using it.
Things like generative art and simple simulations become easy to implement. 

Here's my first crack at some generative art. I've tried to play around with randomizing the bezels on each square and generating an inner square that has randomized location. Sorta looks like many eyes! I wouldn't call it a masterpiece...but one day I'll get there. 

As for tutorials, I've mainly just been reading the docs and trying stuff. Although [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/videos) on youtube has some great content and covers most concepts from beginner to advanced.
